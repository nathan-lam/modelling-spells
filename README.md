# modelling-spells

This is part of a personal project where I explore modelling the capabilities of magic. 

data comes from [this repo](https://github.com/dndManager/dnd5e)
I was unable to replicate the scraping code, so I used the file this person made

This repo is to use dnd spells as provided data to model how advanced magic is based on several factors. Some factors are unable to be implemented into the model
