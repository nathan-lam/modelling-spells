# modelling-spells

This is part of a personal project where I try to model the capabilities of magic (like the fantasy magic). 

data comes from [this repo](https://github.com/dndManager/dnd5e)  
I was unable to replicate the scraping code, so I used the file this person made

This repo uses dnd spells as provided data to model how advanced magic is based on several factors. Some factors were too difficult to implemented into the model.


Qualitatively, Ive identified these factors as foundations to a skilled magic user:  
* Range
* Potency (how much damage, healing, or other)
* Precision (how often can you do acts of precision)
* Cost (how much is spent to cast)
* Efficiency (rate of casting over time)
* Capacity (how much in total a magic user can cast magic)
* Multiplicity (how many targets)
* Duration *how long the magic lasts)
* Concentration (mental effort)

These factors make quite a bit of assumptions, but they are meant to be independent of magic systems (can be applied across stories with different behaving magic, assuming assumptions match)
With the dnd magic system, not all factors could be implemented
